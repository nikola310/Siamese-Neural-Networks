# Siamese-Neural-Networks

## Introduction
Code used for my master thesis. Comparison of two different Siamese neural networks for image recognition: 
1. Keras MNIST Siamese example and
2. [Siamese neural network for oneshot image recognition by Koch et al.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)

## Project structure

MNIST project folder contains scripts for training and testing of Keras' siamese neural network.

OMNIGLOT project folder contains scripts for running siamese neural network by Koch et al.

#TODO
how to prepare and install (requirements.txt)

#TODO
explain the experiment (edit readme.md)

#TODO
code cleaning?
